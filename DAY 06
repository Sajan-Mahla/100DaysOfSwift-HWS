📅 Date: July 10, 2025
🎯 Topics Covered: for, while, break, continue, logic conditions
👨‍💻 Submitted by: Sajan Mahla

🧠 Q1. Print numbers 1 to 10, skipping 5 using continue

for i in 1...10 {
    if i == 5 {
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
✅ Output: 1 to 10 (except 5)

🧠 Q2. Spend ₹20 on tutorials until you're broke (using stride)

for money in stride(from: 100, through: 0, by: -20) {
    print("Bought 1 tutorial")
    print("Money left: \(money)")
    
    if money <= 20 {
        break
    }
}
✅ Output: Prints tutorial purchases until balance is too low.

🧠 Q3. Stop loop at first number divisible by both 13 & 7

(Note: Bug fixed from original answer)

for i in 1..<100 {
    if i.isMultiple(of: 13) && i.isMultiple(of: 7) {
        print(i)
        break
    }
}
✅ Output: 91

🧠 Q4. Loop through string and find vowels a or e

let myString = "appleisawesome"

for char in myString {
    let charString = String(char)
    
    if charString == "a" || charString == "e" {
        print("vowel found: \(char)")
    } else {
        continue
    }
}
✅ Output: Prints each vowel occurrence of 'a' and 'e'

🧠 Q5. Simulate app download in steps of 20%

for percentage in stride(from: 0, through: 100, by: 20) {
    if percentage == 100 {
        print("Download Complete 🎉")
    } else {
        print("Downloading: \(percentage)%")
    }
}
✅ Output:

Downloading: 0%
Downloading: 20%
Downloading: 40%
Downloading: 60%
Downloading: 80%
Download Complete 🎉
🏁 Final Score: 8/10
