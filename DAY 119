so its my day 119, 
so ive came up with a ROADMAP for combine.
here its is:
🍎 21-DAY COMBINE BOOTCAMP
⚙️ Format
Each day = ~1.5–2 hrs (genuine focused coding time)
Every 7th day = Micro-project build day.
🔹 WEEK 1 — Core Concepts & Reactive Thinking
Goal: Understand how data flows in Combine (Publisher → Operator → Subscriber)
Day	Focus	Output
Day 1	Intro to Combine, mental model, Publisher & Subscriber	Make a playground printing emitted values.
Day 2	Just, Future, sink() basics	Emit static & async values (like delayed messages).
Day 3	AnyCancellable & memory handling	Observe what happens when you don’t store subscriptions.
Day 4	Basic operators — map, filter, compactMap	Transform a stream of numbers and strings.
Day 5	Error types (Never vs Failure)	Create a small example throwing and catching errors.
Day 6	Build your first chain	Chain map + filter + sink in a single pipeline.
Day 7 🧠 Project:	“Number Streamer” — user inputs a number, emits countdown every second	Practise subjects + timers.
🕓 Total so far: ~10 hrs
🔹 WEEK 2 — Async + Networking Mastery
Goal: Make Combine talk to the internet.
Day	Focus	Output
Day 8	URLSession.dataTaskPublisher	Fetch mock API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder posts).
Day 9	Threading: .subscribe(on:) & .receive(on:)	Observe UI freeze differences.
Day 10	Error handling: catch, replaceError, tryMap	Handle fake API failures gracefully.
Day 11	CombineLatest / Merge / Zip	Merge two API calls into one combined result.
Day 12	Subjects: PassthroughSubject vs CurrentValueSubject	Bridge manual events with Combine pipeline.
Day 13	Time-based ops: debounce, throttle, delay	Learn how to handle search text input.
Day 14 🧠 Project:	“Weather Combine” — Debounced search + live weather API + reactive UI	Full working app.
🕓 Total so far: ~20 hrs
🔹 WEEK 3 — Combine + SwiftUI + Advanced Flow
Goal: Merge reactive backend logic with SwiftUI front-end.
Day	Focus	Output
Day 15	@Published + ObservableObject	Make a ViewModel that updates UI reactively.
Day 16	assign(to:on:) + binding Combine output	Auto-update label text from publisher data.
Day 17	Debugging Combine: .print() + .handleEvents()	Log pipeline events for clarity.
Day 18	Combine + async/await bridge	Convert Combine publisher to async sequence.
Day 19	Reusable Combine network layer (NetworkManager)	Create a generic Combine-based API handler.
Day 20	Review + optimization	Refactor old code to reactive architecture.
Day 21 🧠 Final Project:	“GitHub Profile Fetcher” — Reactive search, live API, Combine ViewModel	Real Apple-level mini app.
