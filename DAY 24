📱 GuessTheFlag – Learning Journal

🗓️ Date: 28th July 2025
🚀 App #6 Built – Day 24 Swift Journey
🧠 What I Learned:
✅ How to use @State for dynamic UI state management.
✅ RadialGradient background styling to create Apple-level UI.
✅ Used VStack, Spacer, and .padding() for structured layout.
✅ Created a score-tracking mechanism using state and alerts.
✅ Practiced Button actions with parameterized functions.
✅ Built a dynamic list of countries using .shuffled() and correctAnswer = Int.random(...).
✅ Displayed alert using .alert(...) with isPresented binding.
🛠️ SwiftUI Techniques Used:
Concept	Swift Feature Used
State Management	@State properties
UI Layout	VStack, Spacer, .padding, .frame
Images + Styling	Image(...).clipShape(.capsule).shadow()
Gradients	RadialGradient
Alerts	.alert(isPresented:)
Randomization	.shuffled() + Int.random(in: 0...2)
⚙️ Key Code Snippets:
@State private var countries = ["Estonia", "France", ...].shuffled()
@State private var correctAnswer = Int.random(in: 0...2)

Button {
    flagTapped(number)
} label: {
    Image(countries[number])
        .clipShape(.capsule)
        .shadow(radius: 5)
}
💡 Insights / Takeaways:
📌 @State variables update the UI automatically — no need for manual refresh.
📌 SwiftUI alerts are super declarative — clean and readable.
📌 Randomizing array for game logic is easy and powerful with .shuffled().
📌 Clip shapes and shadows add polish with very little code.
📌 Design and gameplay can evolve — this was a great template for future interactive apps.
🔮 Future Improvements:
 Add a Score Counter visible and updating after every question.
 Add animations on correct/wrong flag taps.
 Add high score tracking using @AppStorage or UserDefaults.
 Add flag descriptions or facts to make it educational.
 Refactor code into MVVM structure for scalability.
📝 Final Thought:
This game taught me the power of SwiftUI’s declarative UI + state-driven updates.
Building logic + UI simultaneously = Faster Development.
And I’m one step closer to Apple-level app skills.
