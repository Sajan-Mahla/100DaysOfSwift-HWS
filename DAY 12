// MARK: - Summary

/*
 ▸ Access control lets you protect properties/methods based on scope:
    - private      = same type only
    - fileprivate  = same file
    - internal     = (default) same module
    - public/open  = outside modules (with some restrictions)

 ▸ static means something belongs to the TYPE, not the INSTANCE.
    You don’t need to create an object to access it.
