so here's the SNIPPET of today's CODE- 
import Combine

enum NetworkError: Error {
    case offline
}

let successPublisher = [10, 20, 30].publisher
let failPublisher = Fail<Int, NetworkError>(error: .offline)

let cancellable = successPublisher
    .setFailureType(to: NetworkError.self) // unify error types
    .merge(with: failPublisher)
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { print("Completion: \($0)") },
          receiveValue: { print("Value: \($0)") })



LIKE NOW THIS SUNDAY IM THINKING SOMEWHAT FULL-STACK...
