✅ Day 1 Swift Test (Hacking With Swift - 100 Days)

🧠 Topic: Variables, Constants, Strings, Type Inference

-------------------------------
Questions & My Answers:
-------------------------------

1. ❓ How do you declare a constant named `city` with the value `"Lahore"`?

✅ Answer:
let city = "Lahore"


2. ❓ What’s the difference between `let` and `var`?

✅ Answer:
`let` creates constants that cannot be changed.  
`var` creates variables that can be changed later.


3. ❓ What is type inference in Swift?

✅ Answer:
Swift automatically detects the type based on the value assigned.  
Example: `let score = 90` — Swift treats `score` as an `Int`.


4. ❓ Fix the error:
var name = "Taffy"  
name = 23

✅ Answer:
You can't assign an `Int` to a `String` variable.  
Fix:
var name = "Taffy"  
name = "Sajan"


5. ❓ What will this print?
let name = "Taffy"  
let message = "Welcome, \(name)!"  
print(message)

✅ Answer:
Welcome, Taffy!


6. ❓ Is this valid in Swift? Why or why not?
let age: Int = "Twenty"

✅ Answer:
❌ Invalid — "Twenty" is a `String`, not an `Int`.  
Fix: `let age: String = "Twenty"`


7. ❓ Write code to store your name and favorite fruit, then print:  
"My name is ___ and I love ___."

✅ Answer:
let name = "Taffy"  
let fruit = "Mango"  
print("My name is \(name) and I love \(fruit).")
