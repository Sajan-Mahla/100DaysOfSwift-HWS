so today was but confusing, by mistake I opened the uikit tutorial instead of swift and doing it, doing it. 
later realized it's not the thing I'm working upon ðŸ˜‚.


so I again shifted on 100 DAYS OF SWIFTUI 
and done these things:-

- Buliding a primary list of items 
- Presenting a default view on iPad
- Creating a detail view for resorts
